Text-EasyTemplate

A simple text template system without a lot of complex and unnecessary features
present in other existing template systems. It aims at ease of use without the
need of setting up lots of configurations or complex frameworks. Ideal for
simple applications, it can be used for any type of purpose: web, merge mail,
or any other type of text.

This is the first release of this module. It currently supports simple value
substitution and simple if-else-endif conditionals on templates read from file.
Planned features include nested conditionals and supplying user generated
strings as templates.
